            <p>Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures, and community. You can survive the night or build a work of art - the choice is all yours. But if the thought of exploring a vast new world all on your own feels overwhelming, then fear not! Let's explore what Minecraft is all about!</p>

            <h3>Creative</h3>
            <p>Creative is a mod on Minecraft which allows you to do anything you want! Plus you can't die! You can fly, have access to every block in the game, and have access to all animal and monster eggs in the game! You can build anything with ease, the only limitation is your mind. </p>
            <h3>Survival</h3>
            <p>Survival is the other mod in Minecraft. Players must collect resources, build structures, battle mobs (monsters), eat, and explore the world in an effort to survive. Don't worry, though you can make cool weapons and armor from different ores to protect yourself. It's an adventure down there! Have fun exploring the magical world of Minecraft with all its exciting ores and mysterious creatures!</p>
