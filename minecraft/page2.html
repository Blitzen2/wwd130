            <h3>Skeletons:</h3>
            <p>Skeletons are very common in Minecraft and will just simply shoot at you with arrows. Skeletons will catch fire if they are exposed to direct sunlight, unless they have a helmet on to protect them. When killed, they might drop bones, a bow, or arrows. </p>

            <h3>Zombies:</h3>
            <p>Zombies are monsters that, like skeletons, will die in sunlight. If you kill a zombie you will most likely recieve a piece of rottun flesh. You can eat rotten flesh, but will most likely be poisened. They also will attack villagers. There are adult and baby Zombies.</p>

            <h3>Creepers:</h3>
            <p>Creepers are strange creatures that contain explosives. They will blow up if you get too close to them, blowing up everything in the area. However, you have a warning. You can hear their hissing and a couple of ticks luke a bomb going off before they explode. Their blast radius is not huge, but it is powerful and can easily kill you if you're not careful. Creepers do not burn in the sunlight like skeletons and zombies. When killed, creepers can drop gunpowder, which is useful as you progress more in the game. </p>

            <h3>Spiders:</h3>
            <p>There are two types of spiders. The larger ones spawn anywhere in the dark, like any monster, while the samaller ones spawn only in abandoned mineshafts underground and they are poisonous. Regular spiders are not poisonous. Spiders can also climb and jump to spots that other monsters can not reach. When killed, spiders drop string, which is useful for making bows and fishing lines, or they drop spider eyes. </p>

            <h2>How do you defend against Monsters?</h2>
            <p>You can get different ores and craft armor and weapons to defend yourself with and kill them. You can also place torches down and monsters wont spawn there because there is light. So, if you're mining, in a cave, or it is night time, if you simply place torches down on the floor or walls everywhere then less mobs or zero mobs will spawn there and you'll be safe!</p>
